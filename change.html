                        <p>The aim of /change is to create a series of paintings that can be viewed as-is as well as have a separate element of augmented reality and projection mapping.<br><br>
                        These external alterations on the still image is a hybridization of printed media as well as interactive media and plays on the concept of viewing art through another channel. A viewer has the choice to observe the art piece quietly, loudly, or by pulling their AR app up on their phone.<br><br>
                        The concept chosen for this piece coincides with the aspect of change that AR and projection mapping cause. Seasons are the most commonly noted type of change, and whilst beauty in their state, with each shift to the next season the other must alter to give way.<br><br>
                        Ultimately, the finished project is predicted to have four finished illustrations that each have an animation associated with each that transitions into the other illustration.</p>

                        <p>As stated within the timeline listed above, currently the project is in its creation and experimentation phase. The progress is a little delayed, as the first image is not fully completed just yet, but augmented reality testing has already begun. An important step in this testing is to see if the trigger image needs to contain a bold marker (as shown with the blue rectangle) or if the trigger is able to be a less clear and distinct image.<br><br>
                        Another aspect that needs to be tested during this time is the rendering of the image. The current state of the first painting is aiming for a relatively full rendered final product, but this may prove to be difficult for animation purposes. For this reason, both high rendered and less rendered images will be tested to see which is a more feasible option.
