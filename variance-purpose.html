                    <br><a class="title">PURPOSE</a><br><br>
                    <p>The reason I want to do this is because I wanted to show a hybridization of what is considered “traditional” forms of art for consumption with the interactivity that audience members have come to see in modern day works that incorporate computing and art. Before any form of digital media came into contact with art, the subject usually only included stationary pieces, such as paintings and sculpture. I wanted to represent how the shift from traditional to digital does not mean choosing one or the other, but the ability to incorporate the two into a functioning piece. Part of the purpose of the piece is to show the evolution of one-dimensional pieces (in terms of what you could do with a piece of art) to a multi-dimensional piece that allows a viewer to see a painting depending on whether they decide to look at it unaided or through a screen. <br><br>
                    I also chose to use augmented reality applications in order to show animations in a non-destructive way that would not alter the existing image. Typically, we only see animations displayed on a screen if we want to display it as a “moving painting.” But I want to take advantage of the different digital tools that allow for an animation to be seen without the painting being displayed on the screen itself. <br><br>
                    Simply creating animations overlaying paintings is not my sole purpose in this project either. Augmented reality is able to pull back a curtain and showcase something with its technology, and the content should be able to reflect this subject matter as well. Much like the illustrations have an underlying imagery, individuals also carry a type of underlying part of themselves that stay hidden to the outside world. In the illustrations, I will be able to show what remains concealed by revealing them through the use of augmented reality. <br><br>
                    Through this particular medium and this particular subject matter, I hope for the audience to be able to see how the subtle variances within each person are unique and are the pieces that make up an individual, while simultaneously showing that there is a sense of sameness across the board.<br><br>
                    The pieces of existing art that already utilize augmented reality are interesting on the front of technology, but at the same time they only do their part in showcasing the technology in its essence, rather than being able to hold more substance that what is presented on the surface level. In projects such as ARART, classical pieces of work are animated, such as the Mona Lisa moving within the frame. But these preexisting paintings that are now becoming altered after the death of their artists means that the effect is purely for a very visual appeal, rather than carrying a deeper weight in a second meaning. If we were to suppose that the artist was still alive and able to utilize the technologies of the modern age, we can assume that the hidden imagery will hold a different kind of meaning. Augmented reality has many capabilities and it has the ability to convey more profound meanings rather than a more shallow visual demonstration.<br><br>
                    Then, the next question that could be asked is why go through all the trouble of even implementing augmented reality in the first place. The physical act of having a painting or piece within the space is the concrete presence of the object, and by simply revealing something by drawing back a curtain, or something of a similar nature, does not hold enough impact as something as fleeting and as temporary as a digital image on the screen. Only then are we capable of seeing how the absence of something is magnified.<br><br>
                    We can see with projects such as the Museum of Stolen Art how exactly the absence is able to be amplified. In a typical gallery space, the Museum of Stolen Art only displays images of augmented reality barcodes that, when scanned, show a piece of art that has disappeared from theft. The visceral feel of having such stark, black and white barcodes be on display and only having a digital recreation to go off of, the observers are able to physically feel the emptiness of the gallery. In this way, by having only a digital overlay on top of my illustrations, I want to be able to demonstrate a type of physicality in the things that we are unable to see.  <br><br>
                    Augmented reality is becoming a viable piece of technology that will be able to change the way artists and viewers are able to interact with a stationary image. Often times, there seems to be a rift between art and technology due to the nature of science’s technicality and art’s imagination, yet the two need each other in order to stimulate and grow. When we think of augmented reality, art is not necessarily the first thing that comes to mind. But with more projects such as Prosthetic Reality exposing the world to how augmented reality can work in conjunction with art, the acceptance as well as relevance of art using advancing technology increases. Although it can appear gimmicky at times, the flashy demonstrations that can be put on through this technology will expose more people to this new cultural form. Even if I’m content using the current means of creating art, I want to be able to create something that will be part of the growing history of technology in art.
